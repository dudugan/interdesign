                    for <b>Project 1: <i>Collection</i></b>. I realized 
                    that while we so often take photos of each other smiling,
                    we almost never capture our laughs, and I wanted to rectify
                    this, at least for myself and my friends. I love laughs
                    because they're often so recognizable. I can tell exactly
                    which laugh belongs to which friend in an instant. I
                    really like this, and want to bring this realization to
                    others as well. 
                    <br><br>
                    I went through a lot of different stages in the design
                    process for this one. After the final critique, I had resolved
                    to completely change up the aesthetic. In particular, I was really
                    inspired by Ellie's presentation of her Tool for One (the
                    prank message creator), and wanted to bring that vibe to the design. 
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately, I'm not a great artist, and so hand I drew didn't
                    look that great, and I couldn't figure out how to get the boxes
                    to work in time, and so the design is... basically unchanged from
                    its initial form, <i>but</i> know that I did test out other things
                    (<a href="SMTH">here's a screenshot!</a>) and plan to work on it
                    after finals end so I can get it to a form I actually like!

                    break;
                case 'turntable':
                    descrips.innerHTML = `
                    <i>Nucleica</i> is a bimodally interactive musical composition created
                    for <b>Project 2: <i>Tool for one</i></b>. I wanted to somehow combine
                    two disparate passions of my mom's into a single piece: thinking about DNA,
                    and mixing music. The piece is interactive in two ways: first, the 
                    actual chords played are determined by the DNA file either uploaded or
                    chosen by the listener (my mom), and second, the listener can take an
                    active role in the piece while it's running by moving the four sliders up
                    and down, which each correspond to the levels of a different set of instruments
                    and samples. I also took care in designing something that felt natural both
                    on mobile and web. 
                    <br><br>

                    In the creation of this piece I 
                    learned how to use Tone.js, got way better at regular javascript, 
                    composed a musical piece, and created a fairly large sample library
                    in the process. 
                    <br><br>

                    I am also very proud of the design of this piece - probably moreso than 
                    any of the others I made in this class. I really thought a lot about
                    each element. The backgrounds fading into each other are meant to signal how
                    the sliders were used and also to give a sense of the natural world, of
                    natural beauty reached after a long hike - a common and powerful occurrence in my mom's
                    life. I also just find playing around with them and the backgrounds very enjoyable. 
                    The wooden texture of the box is meant to evoke the trailheads 
                    at the end of her journey, as well as traditional dj-sets and synths. 
                    And much more than any of my other pieces, I think this one looks beautiful. 
                    <br><br>

                    I also made substantial changes to this project after the critique. Among other changes,
                    I made the ‘select organism’ button show which organism was selected after
                    the selection page goes away and changed the emoji slider labels to black icons
                    that I felt better matched the wooden vibe.

                    as something that takes things in but doesn't put much out, and as an analogy for
                    how I perceive myself and think others perceive me (although maybe this isn't
                    really much how I was in our class). I was proud of the idea of using the webcam as a forced
                    mirror to demonstrate this theme.

                    fun and kind of hints at an older internet age where things didn't have
                    to look nice to be funny and used.`;
