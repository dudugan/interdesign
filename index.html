                Making digital things seem physical is one way of 
                getting <a href="https://reallifemag.com/bad-metaphors-close-to-the-metal/">
                    farther from (and in some positive sense closer to!) the metal
                </a>.
                There's something nice about
                physical things, something comforting to our 
                physically-evolved human souls. Just because you <i>can</i>
                do so much more on the internet doesn't mean you need to :)
                <br><br>
                Near the end of this class I realized that a lot of my projects
                share this common theme. <i>Nucleica</i> is a digital amalgation
                of two physical things - a trailhead and a synthesizer. Similarly, 
                <i>LockerNotes</i> is a way to digitalize leaving notes for people to find,
                and <i>Heehee Box</i> is framed as an iPod, evoking the 2000s as well as
                field-recording devices used in Linguistics and Anthropology. I think
                maybe the ‘closer to the metal’ article we read had a bigger impact on me
                than I thought at the time - it’s been on my mind a lot since. Although
                to be honest, I think I’ve liked this kind of thing for years - one of my favorite
                internet artists, <a href="https://www.spencerchang.me/">Spencer Chang</a>, often 
                makes digital things physical, and physical things digital.

                        without falling prey to hesitation or indecision,
                        and move on from mistakes. I want the player to get 
                        a little bit frustrated
                        when playing <i>Gobbler</i> - to repeat to themselves:

                    <i>Heehee Box</i> is a collection of laughs created
                    for <b>Project 1: <i>Collection</i></b>. I realized 
                    that while we so often take photos of each other smiling,
                    we almost never capture our laughs, and I wanted to rectify
                    this, at least for myself and my friends. I love laughs
                    because they’re often so recognizable. I can tell exactly
                    which laugh belongs to which friend, in an instant. I
                    wanted to bring this realization to
                    others as well. 
                    <br><br>
                    I went through a lot of different stages in the design
                    process for this one. After the final critique, I resolved
                    to completely change up the aesthetic. In particular, I was really
                    inspired by Ellie’s presentation of her Tool for One (the
                    prank message creator), and wanted to bring that vibe to the design. 
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately, I didn’t have much time to implement the new aesthetic,
                    so it’s still pretty rough around the edges. For example, I wanted 
                    (and still currently plan) to make the borders of each box feel
                    more hand-drawn like the borders around the boxes of Chris’s project. 
                    I’m also not a great visual artist, and so the hand I drew doesn’t 
                    look that amazing, although I think it works.
                    <br><br>
                    Another thing I changed was that while I kept the frame device for web,
                    I got rid of it for mobile! The idea is that you’re already in some sense
                    ‘closer to the metal’ by touching it with your fingers, so you don’t
                    really need the frame device anymore.

                    break;
                case 'bookmarklet':
                    descrips.innerHTML = `Created for the <b>bookmarklet</b> assignment, 
                    <i>Bookmarklet for Synesthesiacs</i> was actually one of my discarded
                    <b><i>Tool for one</i></b> ideas. I wanted to build off of what we made
                    in class to create something for a specific group of people! 
                    `; 
                    break;
                case 'turntable':
                    descrips.innerHTML = `
                    <i>Nucleica</i> is a bimodally interactive musical composition created
                    for <b>Project 2: <i>Tool for one</i></b>. I wanted to somehow combine
                    two disparate passions of my mom’s into a single piece: thinking about DNA,
                    and mixing music. The piece is interactive in two ways: first, the 
                    actual chords played are determined by a DNA file either uploaded or
                    chosen by the listener (my mom) from a given list of presets, and second, the listener can take an
                    active role in the piece while it’s running by moving the four sliders up
                    and down, each corresponding to the level of a different set of instruments
                    and samples. I also took care in designing an interface that felt natural both
                    on mobile and web. 
                    <br><br>

                    In the creation of this piece I 
                    learned how to use Tone.js, got way better at javascript in general, 
                    composed a musical piece, and created a fairly large sample library
                    in the process. 
                    <br><br>

                    I am also very proud of the design of this piece - probably moreso than 
                    any of the others I made in this class. I really thought a lot about
                    each element. The backgrounds fading into each other are meant to signal how
                    the sliders were used and also to give a sense of the world around us, of the
                    natural beauty reached after a long hike - a common and powerful occurrence in my mom’s
                    life. I also find playing around with the sliders and backgrounds very enjoyable in itself. 
                    The wooden texture of the box is meant to evoke the trailheads 
                    at the end of my mom’s journeys, as well as traditional dj-sets and synths. 
                    And much more than any of my other pieces, I think this one looks beautiful. 
                    <br><br>

                    I also made substantial changes to this project after critique. Among other changes,
                    I made the ‘select organism’ button show which organism was selected after
                    the selection page goes away, and changed the emoji slider labels to black icons
                    that I felt better matched the wooden vibe.

                    as something that takes things in but doesn’t put much out, and as an analogy for
                    how I perceive myself and think others perceive me (although maybe not in this class).
